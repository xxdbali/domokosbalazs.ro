                            <h2>"Postobot": A Puzzling Adventure in Pixel Art</h2>
                            Exciting news for puzzle game enthusiasts! I want to take a moment to reminisce about "Postobot," a game I developed with my friend Arthur for the Ludum Dare 42 competition. This unique 2D pixel art game offers an intriguing blend of strategy and quick thinking.
                            In "Postobot," you play as a brave robot, tasked with organizing boxes during a war against humans. Your job is to combine boxes to create bigger ones, pushing them strategically to clear space and score points. But watch out â€“ the game gets trickier with each of the 10 levels, as more box sizes come into play.
                            The challenge? If five or more boxes accumulate in the landing zone, you have just 10 seconds to clear them out or face shutdown â€“ a fate no robot wants to meet. Your efficiency is key to survival and success.
                            "Postobot" isn't just a game; it's a story of resilience and adaptation. Despite being wounded in the war and repurposed, our hero robot proves that even in dire situations, there's an opportunity to make a significant impact.
                            Whether you're a fan of puzzles, pixel art, or just love a good story, "Postobot" offers an engaging experience that tests both your mind and reflexes. If you haven't tried it yet, it's time to dive into the world of "Postobot" and see how efficiently you can manage those boxes!
