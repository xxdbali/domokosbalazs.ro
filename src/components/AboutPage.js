                            With over a decade in computer science engineering, I specialize in web app development using
                            Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React, Redux, ES6, and SASS. I excel in solving complex
                            challenges and innovating in technology. Beyond this, game development is my passion,
                            where I enjoy creating engaging 2D and 3D game experiences. I'm also fascinated by
                            electronics and 3D printing, exploring these as hobbies. Committed to lifelong learning,
                            I keep up-to-date with C#, TypeScript, Java, and emphasize clean coding and
                            object-oriented principles. I believe in blending coding skills with marketing,
                            creativity, and strategic thinking to create outstanding projects.
