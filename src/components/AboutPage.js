                            With over a decade in computer science engineering, I specialize in web app development using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React, Redux, ES6, and SASS. I excel in solving complex challenges and innovating in technology. Beyond this, game development is my passion, where I enjoy creating engaging 2D and 3D game experiences. I'm also fascinated by electronics and 3D printing, exploring these as hobbies. Committed to lifelong learning, I keep up-to-date with C#, TypeScript, Java, and emphasize clean coding and object-oriented principles. I believe in blending coding skills with marketing, creativity, and strategic thinking to create outstanding projects.
